From a private dialogue.

Dear [...],

I've been into the blockchains since the release of Litecoin, and am a sw dev participant of one cryptocurrency dev team, and currently working a as lead sw dev of the "..." sw dev team of ... blockchains company.

Having maybe plans to consider blockchains stuff in my own future project, Humanistic Control Network

...After a minute thinking, I think Humanistic Control must have multiple blockchains support, with some humanistic communities and organizations selected classes and instances of blockchains.

That support would be governed by those Humanistic Control communities and organizations in some complex way constantly being thought on and improved in collaboration with humanists.

And under the complex control of humanists.
